# Advent of Code JavaScript Starter

A batteries included starter pack for participating in [Advent of Code](https://www.adventofcode.com) using JavaScript!

## Usage

There are 50 modules, 25 tests and 25 npm scripts along with input files. All files are ready to be implemented with their statements.

For example, to go with Day 01:

1. Write your implementation using TDD.

   ```bash
   $ npm run test:watch -- day01/part1
   ```

2. When you're ready fill in the `src/day01/input` file with your input.
3. Run the npm script to solve the exercise.
   ```bash
   $ npm run day01.p1
   ```
4. Submit the solution to [Advent Of Code](https://www.adventofcode.com).
